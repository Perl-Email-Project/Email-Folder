K.K. LIMITED EDITION is the one with Live and Spin, and the t-shirt & 
all the other goodies. Limited Edition/Special Pack, same thing.

Don't know about the book. I know Patrick owns it, and I'm fairly 
certain it was also a limited edition.

Good luck finding them (in the sincere sense, not in the "fat chance" 
sense)

Hey Wesley!,

I'm afraid to not be able to help much on this one...

I've never even seen the first two, except on Web auctions going for crazy 
prices.

The book seemed to have sold out quickly after its release and I've never 
seen used copies yet... I own this one though, as Chris said, and it's nice!

Hello,

This is my first time to set up WebRT and I have installed rt 2.0.15 on a
SuSE 7.2 box.
I am getting a problem with the httpd.conf file though..I want to set it
up to run with other content on the server and i followed the instructions
in the online manual.However on starting up apache i get the following
error.
***************************************
Syntax error on line 562 of /etc/httpd/httpd.conf:
Invalid command 'PerlRequire', perhaps mis-spelled or defined by a module
not included in the server configuration
/usr/sbin/apachectl startssl: httpd could not be started
************************************

All help will be greatly appreciated.

Regards,
Eric

Hi, 

this means your Apache is not aware about mod_perl. 
Check the installation instructions regarding Apache setup.

Now that is cool. So, will there be any books for me to collect from the
initial reviewers in order that they can have a second review from me??

Well? Will there?

That's alright Patrick.  However, it was only proper for me to first
assume you would know, since you're our trusty guide in all things good.

What's it like (size)?  Is it mostly glamour shots?  If it's behind the
scenes, candid-everday-activity photos that would be fun to see.

Ok, looks like I'm outta luck (too bad I couldn't afford it then, not
that I really can now), but could you add these two (the limited pack
and book) to my slowly growing number of items on my request list.

And thanks for the clarification Remi.  I should have just checked
Comfort cause Ohkura has it nicely detailed:

11/16 -KAHIMI KARIE / SPECIAL EDITION PACK (UPCH-9006) 10000Y = 2CD (7
REMIXIES) + VIDEO (19 tracks+2 CLIPS)+ CD (14 tracks)/ 98 LIVE AT
AKASAKA BLITZ + BOOKLET (UNPUBLISHED PHOTOS) + PREMIUM T-SHIRT + A HANDY
BAG + 4 STICKERS + 5 BUDGES

best,
Wesley

Wesley!
I was in Japan one year ago and I met Mr. Ohkura. I 'd swear I saw a couple
of those " K. Karie bag + t-shirt + CD and whatever".

Try to ask him, maybe one is left there.
