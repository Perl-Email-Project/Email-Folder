K.K. LIMITED EDITION is the one with Live and Spin, and the t-shirt & 
all the other goodies. Limited Edition/Special Pack, same thing.

Don't know about the book. I know Patrick owns it, and I'm fairly 
certain it was also a limited edition.

Good luck finding them (in the sincere sense, not in the "fat chance" 
sense)
