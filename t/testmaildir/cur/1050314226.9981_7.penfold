That's alright Patrick.  However, it was only proper for me to first
assume you would know, since you're our trusty guide in all things good.

What's it like (size)?  Is it mostly glamour shots?  If it's behind the
scenes, candid-everday-activity photos that would be fun to see.

Ok, looks like I'm outta luck (too bad I couldn't afford it then, not
that I really can now), but could you add these two (the limited pack
and book) to my slowly growing number of items on my request list.

And thanks for the clarification Remi.  I should have just checked
Comfort cause Ohkura has it nicely detailed:

11/16 -KAHIMI KARIE / SPECIAL EDITION PACK (UPCH-9006) 10000Y = 2CD (7
REMIXIES) + VIDEO (19 tracks+2 CLIPS)+ CD (14 tracks)/ 98 LIVE AT
AKASAKA BLITZ + BOOKLET (UNPUBLISHED PHOTOS) + PREMIUM T-SHIRT + A HANDY
BAG + 4 STICKERS + 5 BUDGES

best,
Wesley
