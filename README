NAME
    Email::Folder - read all the messages from a folder as Email::Simple
    objects.

SYNOPSIS
     use Email::Folder;

     my $folder = Email::Folder->new("some_file");

     print join "\n", map { $_->header("Subject") } $folder->messages;

METHODS
  new($folder, %options)
    Takes the name of a folder, and a hash of options

    If a 'reader' option is passed in then that is used as the class to read
    in messages with.

  messages
    Returns a list containing all of the messages in the folder. Can only be
    called once as it drains the iterator.

  next_message
    acts as an iterator. reads the next message from a folder. returns false
    at the end of the folder

  bless_message($message)
    Takes a raw RFC822 message and blesses it into a class.

    By default this is an Email::Simple object but can easily be overriden
    in a subclass.

    For example, this simple subclass just returns the raw rfc822 messages,
    and exposes the speed of the parser.

     package Email::RawFolder;
     use base 'Email::Folder';
     sub bless_message { $_[1] };
     1;

  reader
    read-only accessor to the underlying Email::Reader subclass instance
