# ABSTRACT: reads raw RFC822 mails from an mbox file

use Carp;
use IO::File;
use Email::Folder::Reader;
use parent 'Email::Folder::Reader';

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This isa Email::Folder::Reader - read about its API there.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Does exactly what it says on the tin - fetches raw RFC822 mails from an
mbox.

The mbox format is described at http://www.qmail.org/man/man5/mbox.html

We attempt to read an mbox as through it's the mboxcl2 variant,
falling back to regular mbox mode if there is no C<Content-Length>
header to be found.

=head2 OPTIONS

The new constructor takes extra options.

=over

=item C<fh>

When filename is set to C<"FH"> than Email::Folder::Mbox will read mbox
archive from filehandle C<fh> instead from disk file C<filename>.

=item C<eol>

This indicates what the line-ending style is to be.  The default is
C<"\n">, but for handling files with mac line-endings you would want
to specify C<eol =E<gt> "\x0d">

=item C<jwz_From_>

The value is taken as a boolean that governs what is used match as a
message separator.

If false we use the mutt style

 /^From \S+\s+(?:Mon|Tue|Wed|Thu|Fri|Sat|Sun)/
 /^From (?:Mon|Tue|Wed|Thu|Fri|Sat|Sun)/;

If true we use

 /^From /

In deference to this extract from L<http://www.jwz.org/doc/content-length.html>

  Essentially the only safe way to parse that file format is to
  consider all lines which begin with the characters ``From ''
  (From-space), which are preceded by a blank line or
  beginning-of-file, to be the division between messages.  That is, the
  delimiter is "\n\nFrom .*\n" except for the very first message in the
  file, where it is "^From .*\n".

  Some people will tell you that you should do stricter parsing on
  those lines: check for user names and dates and so on.  They are
  wrong.  The random crap that has traditionally been dumped into that
  line is without bound; comparing the first five characters is the
  only safe and portable thing to do. Usually, but not always, the next
  token on the line after ``From '' will be a user-id, or email
  address, or UUCP path, and usually the next thing on the line will be
  a date specification, in some format, and usually there's nothing
  after that.  But you can't rely on any of this.

Defaults to false.

=item C<unescape>

This boolean value indicates whenever lines which starts with

 /^>+From /

should be unescaped (= removed leading '>' char). This is needed for
mboxrd and mboxcl variants. But there is no way to detect for used mbox
variant, so default value is false.

=item C<seek_to>

Seek to an offset when opening the mbox.  When used in combination with
->tell you may be able to resume reading, with a trailing wind.

=item C<next_message>

This returns next message as string

=item C<next_messageref>

This returns next message as ref to string

=item C<tell>

This returns the current filehandle position in the mbox.

=item C<next_from>

This returns the From_ line for next message. Call it before ->next_message.

=item C<messageid>

This returns the messageid of last read message. Call if after ->next_message.
